# MCP Server Implementation Plan

## Stage 1: Foundation and stdio Transport
**Goal**: Basic MCP server with stdio transport and logging infrastructure
**Success Criteria**:
- Server launches and responds to MCP initialize/ping via stdio
- Comprehensive logging to stderr
- Clean project structure with core modules
**Tests**:
- stdio transport message exchange
- MCP protocol compliance
- Logging output validation
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 2: HTTP Transport and Authentication
**Goal**: Add HTTP transport with SSE streaming and authentication
**Success Criteria**:
- HTTP server on /mcp endpoint with environment-based binding ✅
- SSE streaming for real-time communication ✅
- OAuth2/JWT authentication implementation ✅
- Proper error handling and stream lifecycle ✅
**Tests**:
- HTTP POST/GET MCP message handling ✅
- SSE stream establishment and cleanup ✅
- Authentication flow validation ✅
- Origin header security testing ✅
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 3: Core Cluster Tools
**Goal**: Implement essential cluster management tools
**Success Criteria**:
- cluster_ping (ICMP and TCP connectivity) ✅
- cluster_status (node health via node_exporter) ✅
- service_status (systemd service checking) ✅
- resource_usage (memory, CPU, disk monitoring) ✅
**Tests**:
- Tool execution against real cluster nodes ✅
- Error handling for unreachable nodes ✅
- Response format validation ✅
- Performance under concurrent requests ✅
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 4: Advanced Cluster Operations
**Goal**: Add comprehensive cluster management capabilities
**Success Criteria**:
- cluster_info (comprehensive node and service data) ✅
- shell_command execution on remote nodes ✅
- journald_logs aggregation from systemd ✅
- loki_logs querying with LogQL ✅
**Tests**:
- Command execution security and timeout handling ✅
- Log query accuracy and performance ✅
- Multi-node operation coordination ✅
- Resource cleanup and connection management ✅
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 5: Specialized Tools and Integration
**Goal**: Screenshot capabilities and AWS integration
**Success Criteria**:
- screenshot_url with headless Chrome
- screenshot_dashboard with Authelia authentication
- AWS service integrations (S3, Bedrock, Route53)
- Full tool registry and configuration system
**Tests**:
- Screenshot generation and format validation
- Authentication bypass for dashboard captures
- AWS API integration and error handling
- End-to-end tool chain validation
**Status**: Not Started

## Development Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- Rust 2024 toolchain with cross-compilation support
- Docker for container testing
- Access to Goldentooth cluster for integration testing
- MCP client for protocol testing

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests with real cluster
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Logging audit completed
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### Implementation Order Rationale

1. **stdio First**: Simpler transport mechanism, easier debugging, foundation for MCP protocol
2. **HTTP Second**: More complex but enables multi-client support and production deployment
3. **Core Tools Third**: Essential cluster operations that provide immediate value
4. **Advanced Operations Fourth**: Build on core foundation, add sophisticated capabilities
5. **Specialized Tools Last**: Non-essential but high-value features like screenshots

### Risk Mitigation

- **Transport Complexity**: Implement stdio thoroughly before HTTP to understand rmcp integration
- **Authentication Security**: Use existing cluster PKI patterns, avoid custom crypto
- **Cluster Integration**: Start with read-only operations, add write operations carefully
- **Performance**: Profile early with realistic cluster sizes and concurrent clients
- **Error Handling**: Design comprehensive error types upfront, avoid retrofitting

### Success Metrics

- **Functionality**: All existing MCP tools replicated with improved error handling
- **Performance**: <5s response time for cluster status operations (limited by SSH network latency)
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime in production deployment
- **Security**: Zero security incidents, comprehensive audit trail
- **Usability**: Both transports work identically for all operations
